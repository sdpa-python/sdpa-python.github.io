# Installing SDPA for Python

SDPA for Python can be installed for `x86_64` through `pip`

```bash

```

Wheels for other architectures are not currently available but we have provided build instructions for Windows, Linux and macOS if you would like to build it from source. `sdpa-python` has currently not been tested on other architectures.
